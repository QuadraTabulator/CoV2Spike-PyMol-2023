# CoV2Spike-PyMol-2023
- My Spring 2023 (Feb - May) term project for NYU's Protein Biochemistry graduate course (M.S. Biology).
## Features:
- Analysis of ACE2 receptor protein structure in human vs mouse variants using data from the [Protein Databank.](https://www.rcsb.org/)
- Analysis of the three established conformations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: closed (PDB code: 6VXX), open (6VYB), and erect (6ZGG).
- Brief analysis of Omicron spike glycoproteins' structure and how it affected their evasion of vaccinations at the time
