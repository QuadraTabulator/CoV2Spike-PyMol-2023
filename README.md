My Spring 2023 (Feb - May) term project for NYU's Protein Biochemistry graduate course (M.S. Biology). Analysis of ACE2 receptor protein structure in human vs mouse variants using data from PDB. Analysis of the three established conformations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Brief analysis of Omicron spike glycoproteins included.
